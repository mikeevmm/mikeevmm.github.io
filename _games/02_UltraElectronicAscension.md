Ultra Electronic Ascension (or UEA, for short) was my first attempt at making a music-driven
game.

Heavily inspired by [Electronic Super Joy](http://www.electronicsuperjoy.com/), it features
fast electronic tracks --- in fact, the best part of development was speaking to every composer.

[It was featured in Warp Door.](http://warpdoor.com/2014/08/09/ultra-electronic-ascension-miguel-murca/)

The game can be found on [itch.io](https://miguelmurca.itch.io/uea).
