As a physics student, I'm required to write a lot of math in text documents.

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) is a well known typesetting tool, made for this very purpose ---
it has a distinct (and clear-ish) notation for writing complex equations, yielding good results.

Unfortunately, LaTeX is still a typesetting tool, and not a text processor. From their website:

> LaTeX is not a word processor!
> Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents
> but to concentrate on getting the right content.

As such, it usually makes for cumbersome to write and hard to read files,
making it uncomfortable to write documents with.

This is why I wrote [TeXDown](https://github.com/mikeevmm/TeXDown), a transpiler
converting from an adapted [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
to `.tex` files.

From its site:

> TeXDown doesn't intend to replace either Markdown or LaTeX.
> In fact, it is more useful when used in conjunction with raw LaTeX;
> it eases the creation of templates or rough document drafts,
> while maintaining ease of code reading, that can then be further tweaked.
> 
> In this sense, TeXDown intends to bridge a gap between the powerful,
> but sometimes cumbersome, LaTeX language, and the easy to read and write Markdown language.

I made this tool for myself, and I'm happy that it has been so useful.
I hope that by making it open source, it can be improved upon and be used by students alike.
