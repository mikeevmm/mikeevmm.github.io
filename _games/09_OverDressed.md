OverDressed started as a silly idea for a shedding game,
but quickly went on to make it to print.

It is my first contact with physical games, which I hope
does well.

~~ At the time of writing it is on sale on [BigCartel][BC].~~ 

~~[BigCartel Page for OverDressed][buy]~~ 

I'm currently considering a revamp of the game, so I've put BigCartel on hold for now. News soon<sup><sup>hopefully</sup></sup>!
