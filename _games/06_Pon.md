Pon's birth can be entirely attributed to [Kate Compton's GDC talk on procedural generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU).

After watching it, I started thinking about a deterministic strategy game that could be generated backwards,
and that could branch complexly, even with simple rules.

Eventually, the game's focus shifted to a smooth design, inspired by that of [Monument Valley](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/),
converging into what it is now.

It's the first full game I published made on Unity and targeting HTML5.
