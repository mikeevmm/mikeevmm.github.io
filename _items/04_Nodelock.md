Nodelock was more of a proof of concept than a game: I belive the idea at its core has potential ---
a game like Niantic's [Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/) but fast paced and between small groups ---
but its execution still eludes me.

It's also a concept that I return to frequently, with Nodelock being the only published version.

In the end, Nodelock was an exercise in web design, specifically with the [Meteor framework](https://www.meteor.com/),
and the first time I made a web app.

Maybe one day Nodelock comes back as a mobile game, when the technology is there.
