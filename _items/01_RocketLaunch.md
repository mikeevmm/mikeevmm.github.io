At the time I developed RocketLaunch, I was using [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net/)
and was an active member of its forums. There I made contact with [KickbackGames](http://kickbackgames.com/),
eventually releasing the game for android with them.

The original web (flash) version is still up at [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/rocketlaunch/23903).
