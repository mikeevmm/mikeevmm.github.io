Planet Squares Inc. (or PSI, for short) came from a wish of making a bigger game --- both gameplay and production wise --- and
of applying what I'd learned so far as a game developer to a new project.

On the other hand, PSI also allowed me to focus on narrative, rather than just on gameplay, something I'd wanted
to do after playing [Battleblock Theater](http://www.battleblocktheater.com/). Even though the game's text
is not central to the gameplay and intends to be unobtrusive, I was able to develop a character through monologue. 

It's, personally, my favourite project so far, and undoubetly the most successful one: it won several awards
at [MakerFaire Lisbon 2016](http://makerfairelisbon.com/en/).
