I found out about modular synthesiser music on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November of 2016, by means of [a tweet](https://twitter.com/mikeevmm/status/793503609560375296) of [Renaud BÃ©rard](https://twitter.com/renaudbedard) (famous for his work on the videogame FEZ), and immediately expressed my interest in simulators that would allow me to try it for myself. Almost exactly one year later, on the 5<sup>th</sup> of November of 2017, [@TheWzzard](https://twitter.com/TheWzzard) introduced me to the wonderful world of [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com), a piece of software to do exactly that: simulate modular synths.

In May 18<sup>th</sup> 2019, I paid it forward by hosting a workshop on learning the ropes of VCV Rack in the Physics Department of the University of Coimbra. It had moderate success, gathering 8 participants --- which isn't bad for such a niche topic! --- and generally positive feedback.

Modular synthesiser music ties the worlds of physics, programming and music together, and is one of my favourite hobbies.

I hope to have the opportunity to host the workshop again.
