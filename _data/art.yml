    Though I don't believe anyone I personally know would imagine me writing a
    rap track, the effort brought together previous experimenting with music
    making, sampling, and poem writing. Perhaps because of this, and completely
    inspired by the structure of MFDOOM's work,these songs don't have so much a
    traditional verse/chorus structure, but rather work more as a specific
    delivery of a poem.

- name: TAU-800B Super
  blurb: >
    A multidisciplinary work involving time-travel, presented for the Processing Community
    Day Coimbra 2021 edition. Installation presented in the downtown of Coimbra, and
    corresponding presentation talk alongside other 5 selected artists.
  description: |
    As a follow up to my submission to the Processing Community Day 2020, I decided to
    collaborate with a friend to create a more ambitious project. Working on the theme of
    "anachronism", André Duarte and I built a full emulation of a computer that makes use
    of time travelling to speed up its computation, and presents a (retro-)futuristic
    interface, while also obeying computing paradigms of the minicomputers of the 70s.
    To achieve this, we combined web technologies and low-level programming. To fully
    complement this alternate reality, we created an accompanying user manual in LaTeX,
    displayed as part of the installation.

- name: Zen Garden
  blurb: >
    Zen Garden was my entry for the Processing Community Day (PCD) Coimbra 2020 edition,
    with the theme "25."
    The piece was selected for exhibition (alongside 24 other artists).
  description: |
    The Processing Community Day is a decentralized event proposed by the
    [Processing](https://processing.org/) community. Therefore, the event is focused on
    computational art/creativity. For the Coimbra edition of the PCD 2020, the proposed
    theme was "25", both in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Processing, but also
    exploring the Portuguese connections to the number, as the (second) Portuguese
    democratic revolution took place on the 25th of April, 1974. The poster I submitted
    was constructed using Signed Distance Fields, such that each pixel can be calculated
    individually. By plotting the iso-lines of the function, one gets the emerging effect
    of interference between the different sources, reminiscent of the sand-lines in a zen
    garden.

  description: |
    meegleeto.com was fully crafted by hand, with HTML and CSS only. It's hosted on Github
    Pages, and so uses Jekyll as a static website engine. I made a point not to use
    Javascript: I'm not necessarily a luddite, but I like my static pages static, and you
    can get very far with CSS nowadays. This is the second iteration on the design, as the
    first version was much more "bootstrap"-y. This time, I went for something a little
    more brutalist, with an eye towards typography. This is more in line with my recent
    work and interests. Furthermore, the print version of my portfolio is simply a print
    of my homepage, adequately formatted with CSS.

    "Contos do Malibu Cola" is my personal tribute to "Contos do Gin-Tonic", by
    Mário-Henrique Leiria. The latter, being a book published during the Portuguese
    dictatorship of 1933-74, manages to violently critique fascism under a veil of humor
    and dadaism. After reading "Contos do Gin-Tonic", and its sequel, "Novos Contos do
    Gin (seguidos de algumas Fábulas do Futuro Pŕoximo)", I felt compelled to write texts
    in the same vein, dealing with personal and existential anxieties. There's hardly an
    audience for this book, admittedly. Or rather: I'm the audience for this book, and I'm
    fine with that.

- name: VCV Rack Workshop
  blurb: >
    I hosted a workshop on modular synthesis at the Physics Department of the University
    of Coimbra. It focused on getting started with the VCV Rack simulation software, as
    well as the theoretical aspects behind synthesis.
  description: |
    I found out about modular synthesiser music on the 1st of November of 2016, by means
    of [a tweet](https://twitter.com/mikeevmm/status/793503609560375296) by
    [Renaud Bérard](https://twitter.com/renaudbedard) (a co-author of the video-game FEZ),
    and immediately expressed my interest in simulators that would allow me to try it for
    myself. Almost exactly one year later, on the 5th of November of 2017,
    [@TheWzzard](https://twitter.com/TheWzzard) introduced me to the wonderful world of
    [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com), a piece of software to do exactly that: simulate
    modular synths.
    On May 18th 2019, I paid it forward by hosting a workshop on learning the ropes of
    VCV Rack at the Physics Department of the University of Coimbra. For such a niche
    topic, it nonetheless gathered 8 participants, to very positive feedback.
    Modular synthesis music ties the worlds of physics, programming and music together,
    and is one of my favourite hobbies.
    I hope to have the opportunity to host the workshop again.

- name: Pon
  blurb: >
    A game where I focused on design, both audio and visual, while exploring the idea of
    procedurally generated puzzle boards, by working backwards from the solution.
  description: |
    Pon's birth can be entirely attributed to [Kate Compton's GDC talk on procedural generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU).
    After watching it, I started thinking about a deterministic strategy game that could
    be generated backwards, and that could branch complexly, even with simple rules.
    Eventually, the game's focus shifted to a smooth design, inspired by that of
    [Monument Valley](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/), converging into what it is
    now.
    It's the first full game I published made on Unity and targeting HTML5.

- name: Overdressed
  blurb: >
    OverDressed started as a silly idea for a shedding game, but quickly went on to make
    it to print.
  description: |
    Overdressed was my first attempt at a physical card game. It sports a fun premise and
    much work behind the scenes to know how each piece of garment (such as a prosthetic
    leg, or a sexy bra) pits against the others. To note, also, is the manual design,
    which imitates the characteristic look of IKEA manuals.
    
    However, Overdressed is still not perfect balance-wise. As such, it is officially in
    hiatus while I rework some aspects of the game into a simpler and more fun experience.

- name: Planet Squares Inc.
  blurb: >
    A multiplayer game. It garnered some success, winning prizes in the 2016 Lisbon Maker Faire.
  description: |
    Planet Squares Inc. came from a wish of making a bigger game --- both game-play and
    production wise --- and of applying what I'd learned so far as a game developer to a
    new project.
    On the other hand, PSI also allowed me to focus on narrative, rather than just on
    game-play, something I'd wanted to do after learning of titles such as
    [Battleblock Theater](http://www.battleblocktheater.com/). Even though the game's text
    is not central to the game-play and intends to be unobtrusive, I was able to develop a
    character through monologue, and a sort of environmental story-telling.
    Planet Squares Inc. won several awards at [MakerFaire Lisbon 2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20161024033505/http://makerfairelisbon.com/en/).

- name: Ultra Electronic Ascension
  blurb: >
    Ultra Electronic Ascension was my first attempt at making a music-driven game.
  description: |
    Heavily inspired by [Electronic Super Joy](http://www.electronicsuperjoy.com/),
    Ultra Electronic Ascension features fast electronic tracks. As part of the development
    process, I spoke to every composer, which was very gratifying. If I were to re-make
    UEA today, I would author the beat maps by hand, rather than using the game's current
    strategy of looking at the waveform.
