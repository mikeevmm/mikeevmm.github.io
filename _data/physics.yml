- title: "An access model for quantum encoded data"
  description: >
    A work investigating how classical access to quantum computation can be
    abstracted, what counts as "faking" a quantum computation, and how powerful
    the resulting abstracted model is. Contains applications to the problem of
    computing a distributed inner product.

- title: "Making the cut: two methods for breaking down a quantum algorithm"
  description: >
    Building upon previous work, we propose specific architectures for
    quantum-classical hybrid algorithms with provable guarantees in the query
    model.

  description: >
    Publication on using Quantum Singular Value Transforms to think about
    algorithms with limited coherence times, and simplifying the derivation of
    a particular instance.
